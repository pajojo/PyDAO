Greetings!

Setting our sights upon importing data from the stock market, we felt the need to
create a tool that will quickly allow our students to convert delimited text + headers
into a Python class.

Order interface is in Alpha. See ./main.py to give it a try!

API Example:
===========
./Demo123.py

The above demonstrates how to generate a HUGE amount of code w/o using any data file(s).

Basic Tests:
===========
SqltDAO.DaoTest01.tc001_gen.py
SqltDAO.DaoTest01.tc001_driver.py

Note that you will need to copy the above into this folder to locate the packages.

For Students:
============
SqltDAO.DaoTest01.GenNasdaq.py

For an example of how to create an Order so as to generate your code!

Note that you will also need to copy the above into this folder to locate the packages.
